### AI Generates:
```
Title: "Peak Element Finder"

Description:
Given an integer array representing daily temperatures, find the 
highest temperature recorded. If multiple days have the same highest 
temperature, return any one of them.

Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [30, 25, 38, 22, 38, 27]
Output: 38

Constraints:
- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- -100 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

Test Cases: (5-7 cases with edge cases)
- Normal case
- All same values
- Single element
- Negative numbers
- etc.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
```
